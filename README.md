# üìö Academic World Dashboard

## Overview

This application is an interactive web dashboard for exploring, querying, and updating the **Academic World** dataset. It seamlessly integrates **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, and **Neo4j** as backend databases, allowing users to discover key researchers, publications, and collaborations across universities.

## üöÄ Purpose

- **Scenario:** Academic researchers, students, and administrators seeking to analyze research output, faculty collaborations, and academic trends across top universities.
- **Target Users:** Researchers, students, university administrators, and anyone interested in academic data analytics.
- **Objectives:**
  - Discover influential faculty and their research.
  - Visualize university and faculty rankings.
  - Update faculty information directly from the dashboard.
  - Explore co-authorship and research networks.

## üß© Widget Descriptions

- **üîπ Widget 1: Research Keywords Analytics (MongoDB)**  
  **What:** Displays  top 25 popular keywords across academic world.  
  **Why:** Helps users identify which research keywords are widely used.  
  **How:** Aggregates keyword frequencies via MongoDB pipelines and ranks by keyword popularity.

- **üîπ Widget 2: Faculty Excellence Dashboard (MySQL)**  
  **What:** Visualizes faculty research output using Keyword-Relevant Citation (KRC) as a measure of excellence.  
  **Why:** Assesses faculty performance based on topic relevance and impact.  
  **How:** SQL queries compute KRC scores and group publication data by year; output is rendered using Plotly.

- **üîπ Widget 3: Research Focus Graph (Neo4j)**  
  *Explore research structure: Faculty ‚Üí Top 5 Publications ‚Üí Top 3 Keywords per publication*  
  **What:** Interactive network graph showing a faculty member‚Äôs key publications and associated topics.  
  **Why:** Highlights both the depth and diversity of a faculty member's research portfolio.  
  **How:** Neo4j Cypher queries extract top publications and keywords, forming a visual research graph.

- **üîπ Widget 4: Faculty Spotlight**  
  *üé≤ Randomly highlights a professor from the dataset*  
  *‚úèÔ∏è Update Faculty Position (MySQL)*  
  **What:** Randomly showcases a faculty profile and enables position editing.  
  **Update:** Faculty (required), Position (input required)  
  **Why:** Engages users by surfacing diverse profiles and supports updating faculty positions.  
  **How:** MySQL query fetches a random faculty entry; update writes to MySQL and propagates to MongoDB and Neo4j via a trigger.

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Techniques Used

This project successfully implements four advanced database techniques:

1. **Indexing**  
   Indexes are automatically created through the use of `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, and `UNIQUE` constraints in the MySQL schema. These indexes help improve query performance, especially in joins and filters used across faculty, keyword, and publication tables.
   ### ‚ö°Ô∏è Indexes Used

1.1. **publication**
   - `PRIMARY` (on `ID`)
   - `id_UNIQUE` (unique index on `ID`)
   - `idx_pub_id` (custom BTREE index)

1.2. **faculty_publication**
   - `faculty_Id`, `publication_Id`
   - Custom indexes: `idx_fp_faculty_id`, `idx_fp_publication_id`, `idx_fp_pub_id`

1.3. **keyword**
   - `PRIMARY` (on `id`)
   - Composite index: `idx_keyword_id_name (id, name)`
![Index](assets/index.png)  

2. **Prepared Statements**
All MySQL queries that interact with user input use parameterized SQL queries via Python's pymysql library, ensuring query safety and efficiency.
Example:
  - `query = "UPDATE faculty SET position = %s WHERE name = %s"
     cur.execute(query, (new_position, name))`
    ![Prepared Statement](assets/prepared_statement.png)  
3. **Trigger Implemented**

**Trigger Name:** `faculty_update_trigger`  
**Table Affected:** `faculty`  
**Event:** `AFTER UPDATE`  
**Description:**  
This trigger logs updates to a faculty member's `name` or `position`.  
If either field changes, an entry is added to `faculty_updates_log`.

**Trigger SQL:**
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER faculty_update_trigger
AFTER UPDATE ON faculty
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF OLD.name != NEW.name OR OLD.position != NEW.position THEN
        INSERT INTO faculty_updates_log (faculty_id, old_name, new_name, old_position, new_position)
        VALUES (NEW.id, OLD.name, NEW.name, OLD.position, NEW.position);
    END IF;
END;
```

This implementation completes the R13‚ÄìR15 requirements by using **Indexing**, **Prepared Statements**, and **Trigger**.
